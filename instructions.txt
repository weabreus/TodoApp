In this test, you will find the base of a TO DO app. Below you will find what you 
need to do in this test.

    - Fix any console error that you find.
    - Style the app as you want without using any framework.
    - Fix and structure the code as you like.
    - Make this app a complete TO DO app by adding the missing features in this
      base code.
    - Add this app to git and do regular commits.

IMPORTANT: You need to do a first commit or initial commit after setting up the project. Also, do regular commits for each added functionality.

You have two hours to finish this after the first commit. When you are done,
send the full URL of the git project and make sure it is a public repository.
